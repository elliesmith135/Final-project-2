# Final-project-2

his game is our final project for the corona themed assignment.  We decided to design a corona themed brick breaker game.  The paddle is a man in a hazard suit and the goal is to destroy all the bricks which protect the corona virus.  Once all the bricks have been destroyed the player has successfully killed the virus and found a cure! The more bricks the player destroys the greater their score increases.  We tried our best with designing this game and our code sometimes got a little tricky.  We hope you enjoy the idea and end the spread of corona in our game !
